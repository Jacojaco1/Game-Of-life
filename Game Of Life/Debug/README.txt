A simulation of the Game of life.
The rules are as follows :
	1)Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, 	as if caused by underpopulation.
	2)Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives 	on to the next generation.
	3)Any live cell with more than three live neighbours 	dies, as if by overpopulation.
	4)Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours 	becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

I used a 80x80 grid to display the cells.
Press P to pause the simulation, and while it's paused, left-mouse button creates cells on desired blocks.
